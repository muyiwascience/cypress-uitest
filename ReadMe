Set Up
******
Install Cypress
** npx cypress install ***


** Download or clone this repo

******
Install dependencies
** npm install **

******
Note: Install faker directly; I added it to Packagejson but it is flaky when you do npm install. The faker version seems to be an issue.

*** npm install faker --save-dev **

******
To run the test
** npm test ***

******
To open cypress integration UI
npx cypress open
